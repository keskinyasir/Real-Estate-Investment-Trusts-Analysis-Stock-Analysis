# Real-Estate-Investment-Trusts-Analysis-Stock-Analysis

In this project, you will analyze Real Estate Investment Trusts, commonly known as REITs. REITs are companies that own or operate real estate that produces income. REITs, like the stocks of regular public companies, are traded on different stock exchanges. Investing in a REIT allows you to invest in portfolios of real estate assets the same way you can invest in a company by buying its stock.
Using financial statistics and NumPy you will analyze two REITs: Sabra Health Care REIT Inc. (NASDAQ: SBRA), which invests in health care real estate, and Equity Residential (NASDAQ:EQR), which invests in rental apartment properties.
The time period for analysis we will be using is Jan 1 2019 to Dec 31 2019. The REIT data for SBRA (SBRA.csv) and EQR (EQR.csv) can be found in the same folder as this file.


if we have portfolio both of these stock, it is not good portfolio because that has positive correlation each other. We should have negative correlation if we want to balance income.
SBRA stock is more risky because of high standard deviation. On the other hand, SBRA has more annually log return than EQR so we earn much more money if we want to get this risky situation.
